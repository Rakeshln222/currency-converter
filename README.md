Convert currencies with ease!

📝 How It Works
The user inputs an amount and selects From and To currencies.

On clicking Convert, the app fetches real-time exchange rates.

The result is dynamically shown below the button.

⚠️ Notes
The app uses a public API endpoint. For production, consider using a secured key or rate-limited API key.

The design can be enhanced with more animations, dark mode, or charts.
